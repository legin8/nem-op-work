# Nigel-Web-1
This is a Website being made for assessment in Web 1 OP for Adon Moskal.

The aim of this assessment is to show competence in use of HTML, CSS and JS.

This project uses the api from unsplash.com, https://api.unsplash.com

Known Bugs:
In block 5 the hover effect that makes the arrow move is broken because of the pointer-events: none; on the Div it's inside, I tried putting it outside of the div but still had the same problem.

This hasn't been changed since it was handed in for grading, looking at it in the future the images may or may not load due to any changes for the api and any changes to the pictures being pulled from other websites. At the time of handing in all the pictures displayed correctly and in the right place.
