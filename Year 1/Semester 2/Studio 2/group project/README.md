This was a group project for Studio 2, My work is in the component called src/lib/WindDisplay.svelte.
The code isn't completely the Svelte way but it mostly is, we had to learn Svelte ourselfs and this was the first time we did this and the others in my group didn't/ couldn't learn it no matter the help that I offered.
