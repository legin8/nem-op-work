This game was made in a group for studio 1 handed in at the end of semester 1.
Nothing has been changed since it was handed in to show my abilitys at the time.

***** Warning althought this was group work, the other people I worked with did hardly anything and mostly just copied my code and tried to take credit for my work and ideas.
**** about 90% of the work is mine without any outside help.
**** I came up with how to move the player, I showed the other how to use different files to do there work to minimize merge conflicts.
**** Zach was the only other person to do any real work on this and he made the last level, even tho it was very basic it was at least something.
Ben and Declan did nothing and only removed my name from their code once Zach pointed it out to them.
